1.  **More Sleep , Less Stress**\
2.  **Early Adults \~ And Stressed**\
3.  **Does Physical Activity Make A Difference ?**\
4.  ***Policy Focus: Sleep & Stress \> Gym Memberships***

## MORE SLEEP , LESS STRESS

-   Good Sleep & Low Stress group shows the highest median weight change, close to zero or slightly positive, with relatively tight variation.

```{r sleep-stress-boxplot, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/pmnha/my-new-project/22660348/Question5/Results/Sleep_Stress_Boxplot.png")


```

## MORE SLEEP , LESS STRESS

-   Poor Sleep & High Stress group experiences the largest median weight loss and greatest variability, with several extreme outliers below -30.

-   Weight change tends to be worse (more negative) with high stress regardless of sleep quality, highlighting stress as a key factor in weight loss.

## EARLY ADULTS \~ AND STRESSED 

-   Early Career Professionals - 30-39 suffer the most severe weight loss (-7.7 lbs) with poor sleep – **5x worse** than their well-rested peers (+1.6 lbs).
-   High stress causes greater weight loss (-9.1 lbs in 30-39 group) than any exercise benefit, with effects compounding when combined with poor sleep (-10+ lbs).
-   Women maintain more stable weight (-1.8 to -3.5 lbs changes) while men show extreme drops, especially teen males (-5.3 lbs vs. -1.8 lbs for females).

## EARLY ADULTS \~ AND STRESSED 

```{r sleep-risk-pivot ,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
library(readr)
library(knitr)
weight_summary <- read_csv("C:/Users/pmnha/my-new-project/22660348/Question5/Results/Weight_Change_Summary.csv")
kable(weight_summary, caption = "Weight Change Summary")
sleep_pivot <- read_csv("C:/Users/pmnha/my-new-project/22660348/Question5/Results/Sleep_Risk_Pivot.csv")
kable(sleep_pivot, caption = "Sleep Risk Pivot Summary")
stress_pivot <- read_csv("C:/Users/pmnha/my-new-project/22660348/Question5/Results/Stress_Risk_Pivot.csv")
kable(sleep_pivot, caption = "Stress Risk Pivot Summary")
```

## DOES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?

-   Physical activity shows *no significant effects*
-   Sleep-stress model explains **45.5%** of weight variation (R²=0.455)
-   Low stress provides **+5.8 lbs** protection (p\<0.05)

## DOES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?

```{r regression-txt-output, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cat(readLines("C:/Users/pmnha/my-new-project/22660348/Question5/Results/Regression_Models.txt"), sep = "\n")
```

## ***Policy Focus: Sleep & Stress \> Gym Memberships***

-   Redirect 90% of corporate wellness budgets from gyms to sleep/stress interventions for employees aged 30-39, where data shows 10x greater ROI potential.
